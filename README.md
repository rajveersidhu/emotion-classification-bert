# emotion-classification-bertAI-Based Emotion Classification Using BERT

Overview

This project implements a BERT-based emotion classification model to analyze and classify text into four emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, and Neutral. The model leverages transformer-based deep learning to detect emotions from textual input.

Features

Fine-tuned BERT model for emotion detection.

Trained using PyTorch & Hugging Face Transformers.

Processes text input and classifies it into four emotion categories.

Supports real-time emotion prediction.

Dataset

Uses a labeled dataset (emotion_dataset.csv) with text samples and emotion labels.

The dataset is preprocessed using tokenization and padding before training.

Model Architecture

BERT-base-uncased from Hugging Face as the backbone model.

Fine-tuned classification head for emotion classification.

Optimized using Adam optimizer & cross-entropy loss.

Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-classification-bert.git
cd emotion-classification-bert

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Training the Model

To train the BERT model, run:

python src/train.py

Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the trained model on validation data:

python src/evaluate.py

Real-Time Emotion Classification

To classify text in real-time:

python src/predict.py "I am feeling amazing today!"

Output: Emotion: Happy

Dependencies

Install required libraries:

pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy
